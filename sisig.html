					<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>Sisig is a Filipino dish made from parts of pig head and chicken liver, usually seasoned with calamansi, onions and chili peppers. Sisig was first mentioned in a Kapampangan dictionary in the 17th century meaning "to snack on something sour" and "salad".</p>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<p>2 pounds pig face (snouts, ears, and jowls)<br>
1 cup vinegar<br>
1/4 cup soy sauce<br>
1 head garlic, peeled and crused<br>
1 teaspoon whole peppercorns<br>
2 bay leaves<br>
1 tablespoon salt<br>
water<br>
1 large onion, peeled and diced<br>
6 Thai chili peppers, stemmed and minced<br>
1/2 cup calamansi juice<br>
1 tablespoon Liquid seasoning (I used Maggi)<br>
1/2 cup liver spread</p>
					<h2>Procedure</h2>
						<p>1. In a large pot, combine pig face, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, 2 tablespoons of salt,  and enough water to completely cover pork. <br>
2. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 50 minutes to 1 hour or until meat is tender. Remove from heat and drain well, discarding liquid.<br>
3. Over hot coals, grill pork for about 7 to 10 minutes on each side or until crisp and slightly charred. Or arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil in a 450 F oven for about 4 to 5 minutes or until nicely charred. <br>
4. Remove from heat, allow to cool to touch, and chop meat.<br>
5. In a large bowl, combine chopped meat, onions, chili peppers, calamansi juice., and liquid seasoning.<br>
6. And liver spread and gently stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br>
7. To serve, transfer to sizzling hot plates.</p>
