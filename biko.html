					<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>Biko is a sweet rice cake from the Philippines. It is made of coconut milk, brown sugar, and glutinous rice. It is usually topped with latik. It is a type of kalamay dish and is prepared similarly, except the rice grains are not ground into a paste. They are also sometimes packaged and sold as suman.</p>
					<h2>Ingredients</h2>
					<p>2 cups glutinous rice aka sticky rice or malagkit<br>
1 1/2 cups water<br>
2 cups brown sugar<br>
4 cups coconut milk<br>
1/2 tsp salt</p>
					<h2>Procedure</h2>
						<p>1. Combine the sticky rice and water in a rice cooker and cook until the rice is ready (we intentionally combined lesser amount of water than the usual so that the rice will not be fully cooked)<br>
2. While the rice is cooking, combine the coconut milk with brown sugar and salt in a separate pot and cook in low heat until the texture becomes thick. Stir constantly.<br>
3. Once the rice is cooked and the coconut milk-sugar mixture is thick enough, add the cooked rice in the coconut milk and sugar mixture then mix well. Continue cooking until all the liquid evaporates (but do not overcook).<br>
4. Scoop the cooked biko and place it in a serving plate then flatten the surface.<br>
5. Share and Enjoy!</p>
